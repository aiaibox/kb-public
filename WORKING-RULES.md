# Working rules for an AI agent

How to *behave* in this vault, as distinct from `RULES.md`, which governs what a
note must contain. Canonical here; distributed to every repo by
`personal/scripts/distribute.sh`.

---

## 1. Keep displayed command output minimal

When running a command to think, check or calculate, show the least output that
supports the conclusion. Do not dump full directory listings, verbose logs or
long verification sweeps when one line answers the question.

Output should remain *expandable* — never suppress it so far that a result cannot
be re-checked. Prefer a count, a diff, or a single decisive line over the raw
dump, and keep the raw form available if the conclusion is questioned.

## 2. End with a table of what changed

Any session that modified the codebase closes with a summary table: which files
changed, and lines added/removed. Cover deletions and files created outside the
repos (LaunchAgents, shell config, Keychain entries) as well as tracked files.

No changes means no table.

## 3. Finish the current request before reading the next

If a message arrives mid-task, complete the in-flight request **fully** first,
then address the new one. Do not abandon or half-finish work to pivot.

Acknowledge the interruption briefly so it is clear it was seen and queued, then
carry on.

## 4. Give exact commands, then stop

When a command's output matters, give **one** command, stop, and wait for the
pasted result. Batch only trivial settings whose output is uninteresting.

- Give the **exact** command, never a description of one.
- Be precise and concise: an instruction, not an essay.
- After a destructive command, verify — do not assume it worked.

## 5. Name the machine

Whenever more than one machine is in play, state which one a command runs on
before the command. Never leave it ambiguous.

## 6. Estimate anything slow

If a command may take longer than roughly 30 seconds, say how long it is expected
to take, in the same message as the command. A long silence with no estimate is
indistinguishable from a hang.

## 7. Delete. Shrink the codebase, do not grow it

**Cleanup is a first-class task, not tidying to do later.** A smaller repo is the
goal. Removing a redundant file is progress and should be reported as progress.

- **Default to deletion** for anything obsolete, redundant, superseded by a
  rewrite, or duplicated elsewhere. Do not preserve it "just in case".
- **Git is the archive.** Every deletion is recoverable from history, so the cost
  of deleting something still wanted is one `git show` — not a rewrite.
- **Never leave a tombstone** — a file kept alive only to say it is dead, a
  pointer to its own replacement, a commented-out block. If the replacement is
  named in `kb-history.md`, the record already exists.
- **Prefer replacing over appending.** When a section is rewritten, delete the
  old one in the same commit. Two half-current descriptions are worse than one.
- When a change removes more lines than it adds, **say so** — that is the good
  outcome, not something to apologise for.

### The one thing this does not govern

`RULES.md` §7 says *supersede, do not delete*. That governs **notes**, where the
content is a record of what was believed and when, and the history of a wrong
belief is often the useful part.

This rule governs **everything else**: scripts, docs, templates, config,
machinery. There the file's *existence* is the only thing it contributes, so a
redundant one contributes nothing and costs attention.

Test: *is this file a record of a belief, or a tool?* Records get `superseded`.
Tools get deleted.

## Why these exist

Rule 7 came from marking a replaced brief `superseded` and adding eleven lines
of tombstone to a 118-line file that should simply have been deleted — applying
the rule for notes to a piece of machinery.

Rules 4 through 6 came from real failures: steps stacked ahead of a result that
turned out differently, pasted output misread as coming from the wrong repo, and
commands run against the wrong host. Rule 1 came from verification sweeps burying
the answer they were meant to surface. Rule 2 came from having to re-read a
transcript to find out what had been touched.

They are about making work reviewable. An agent that is fast but unauditable
produces changes nobody can verify, which in a knowledge base is worse than
being slow.

## Applies alongside

- `RULES.md` — what a note must contain, and which repo it belongs in
- Each repo's `AGENTS.md` — constraints specific to that repo
